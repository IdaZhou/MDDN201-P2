            <h3>Concept to Realisation</h3>
            <p>This project is based on to arouse people awareness of privacy protection. We need to pay attention to not
                only privacy breaches in public video surveillance but also laws and regulations regarding video surveillance
                in private property. Help people to gain some critical information from CCTV, therefore, people can research
                the detail they need on time, such as lost and found, accident replay, etc. CCTV platform expanded the number
                of users, and deliver them a convenient, fast experience to receive the CCTV data.</p>

            <h3>Face recognition app system</h3>
            <p>Unlike other identification solutions such as passwords, verification by email, selfies or images, or fingerprint identification, Biometric facial recognition uses unique mathematical and dynamic patterns that make this system one of the safest and most effective ones.
            </p>
            <p>Facial recognition is a technology that involves classifying and recognizing human faces, mostly by mapping individual facial features and recording the unique ratio mathematically and storing the data as a face print. The face detection in your mobile camera makes use of this technology.  Quick search for identification events among stored data with various search options. A high-performance real-time face detection and recognition system.Enhanced opportunities for managing biometric profiles in the system. When login success it accesses to all operational capabilities.</p>

            <h3>AR navigation map</h3>
            <p>I found most of the traditional CCTV map it very difficult to find the location detail. So i want to add a AR navigation to the website and app. This is one of the main benefits of using AR in maps, as it overcomes the limitation of normal Google Maps â€“ people often get confused about directions, and with GPS updating slowly, they turn in the wrong direction. When the phone is lowered, the AR mode switches turn off and normal navigation resumes.

            <h3>Online lost and found</h3>
            <p>When you find something on the street and cannot find the owner, usually the safe way is gives to the police. And handing it over to the police means that it may take you at least half an hour to an hour of reporting time. So I decide to make a lost and found return box under the CCTV. You can report lost property online. And since the return box under the CCTV. People can upload the information to the app and tag the nearest CCTV when lost something or find something. And CCTV recording can give all the evidence to the police.  Track your lost and found inventory in one online location, add items to the inventory just by taking a picture. Use online digital lost and found tools to verify you are matching the item to the rightful owner, create automated reports easily.
